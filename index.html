          MongoDB is a famous NoSQL database used by various organizations to
          store their data. The data are saved in a JSON-like formed in the hard
          hard disk in order to be used in the future. As stated by

          To begin with you have to install the database. The database can be
          used in various operating systems. Please choose accordingly:
        </p>

        <aside>
          It is worth noting that the guides are referring to the community
          edition of the database. If you would like to use MongoDB for your
          company projects I suggest installing the Enterprise edition.

        <header><h2>Getting started</h2></header>
        <p>
          After completing the above steps we can start working with our
          database. In this guide I am going to show how to perform a wide
          variety of tasks using the Mongo Shell, although a GUI client might
          seem easier.
        </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Open_shell">
          <header><h3>Open shell</h3></header>
          <p>
            To start typing commands a shell has to be opened. To do so you need
            to open a terminal and type
          </p>
          <code> mongosh</code>
          <p>
            After opening the shell a test database is opened by default. In
            order to see the database you are working to, you can type
          </p>
          <code>db</code>
          <p>
            Although we could work in test, we are going to create a new one
            called mydb. The use command will not only create it but it will
            also change the working enviroment to it
          </p>
          <code>use mydb</code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Insert_data">
          <header><h3>Insert data</h3></header>
          <p>
            The data in MongoDB are stored in collections. We could think that
            the collections are the tables of a relational database, although
            the data in them are much more flexible. The collections can store
            different kinds of data, which may not have common fields. So let' s
            assume we would like to create a new collection called students, in
            which the name and age of two persons will be stored. By using the
            <em>insertMany</em> command as shown below a new collection in the
            chosen database is going to be created with the desired name and it
            will contain the data of two students
          </p>
          <code>
            db.students.insertMany([<br />{name: "Mark", <br />
            date-of-birth: 2000 <br />}, <br />
            {name: "Helen", <br />
            date-of-birth: 1999<br />}<br />])
          </code>
          <p>
            A useful feature of MongoDB is that you can assign a list of values
            in an attribute of an object. To do so you have to give the values
            like this
          </p>
          <code>attribute: [value1, value2, ...]</code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Find_data">
          <header><h3>Find data</h3></header>
          <p>
            A key functionality of a database is searching for data. To find
            desired data in a collection when using Mongo, the
            <em>find</em> command comes in mind, which receives arguments like
          </p>
          <code> {attribute1: value1, attribute2: value2, ...} </code>
          <p>
            So imagine we would like to find all students who were born in 1999.
          </p>
          <code> db.students.find({date-of-birth: 18}); </code>
          <p>
            Another important aspect of find is that it can show us all the
            documents in a collection. To print them on screen type
          </p>
          <code> db.students.find({}); </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Delete_data">
          <header><h3>Delete data</h3></header>
          <p>
            Finally we will discuss how to delete a document from a collection
            using the <em>deleteMany({attribute: value, ...})</em> command. As
            an example we will assume that we would like to delete all documents
            from the collection <b>students</b>, in which the name is Helen. To
            accomplish this type
          </p>
          <code> db.students.deleteMany({name: "Helen"}); </code>
